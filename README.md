## Hi! #

My name is Andrew, and welcome to my personal github repository. This is where you can find information about my projects and my interests. 

I am undergrad at the University of Toronto, where I study cognitive science, philosophy and linguistics. In my spare time, I like to write, cycle, and learn by compuslively clicking around the internet. I like being with friends too, but I don't yet have a hobby built around that. 

This is a new site (as of June 2025), and I will be adding to it daily over the next month. Below, I will list some interests of mine that I aim to indulge here. Stay tuned if they interest you too! I am also (as of June 2025) **looking for work**, and you can find a copy of my resume [here](https://github.com/Andrew-Edelmann/Andrew-Edelmann/blob/main/resume.md).
